# Sportify - Frontend

I have done this project in CSCI 5709 - Advanced Web Services during my Masters in Applied Computer Science.
In this project in frontend we used material UI to make web application user interface minimal and responsive. For [backend](https://github.com/UltraHopeful/Sportify-Backend) we use node and express to make APIs with middleware to authorize the request form frontend.
