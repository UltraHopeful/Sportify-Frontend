##  Backend Folder Structure
The backend server has the following folders:

1. The structure of the entities or data utilised in the programme is contained in the "models" folder.
blogs.js are the models used for the blogging functionality. Collection objects are exported from these files and imported in the controllers using  methods like save, findOneAndUpdate, find.

2. "routes" includes the application routes for GET, POST, PUT, and other HTTP requests.
The files in this folder define routes to a number of http methods.

3. The business logic is located in the "controllers" folder.
Index.js's execution control is transferred via routes to the controller.
Business logic is implemented on the obtained data when models have been loaded into controller JS files. 

# Frontend folder hierarchy
1. The project's dependencies are listed in package.json. 'App.js' is the next entry point after index.js. 
2. The "Theme" folder houses the website's overall colour scheme. 
3. The "assets" section includes static information, such as photos used on different web pages. 
4. Presentational components made up of static material are included in "components." 
5. "Pages" include stateful functional components that produce user interface elements in response to user interactions and state. 
6. The static data information required to be incorporated in the components is located in the "data" folder.
